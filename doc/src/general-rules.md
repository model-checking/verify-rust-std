# General Rules

## Terms / Concepts

**Verification Target:** [Our repository](https://github.com/model-checking/verify-rust-std) is a fork of the original Rust repository,
and we kept a copy of the Rust standard library inside the `library/` folder that shall be used as the verification target for all our challenges.
We will periodically update the `library/` folder to track newer versions of the [official Rust standard library](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/).

**Challenges:** Each individual verification effort will have a
tracking issue where contributors can add comments and ask clarification questions.
You can find the list of [open challenges here](https://github.com/model-checking/verify-rust-std/labels/Challenge).

**Solutions:** Solutions to a problem should be submitted as a single Pull Request (PR) to this repository.
The solution should run as part of the CI.
See more details about [minimum requirements for each solution](general-rules.md#solution-requirements).


## Basic Workflow

1. A verification effort will be published in the repository with
appropriate details, and a tracking issue labeled with “Challenge”
will be opened, so it can be used for clarifications and questions, as
well as to track the status of the challenge.

2. Participants should create a fork of the repository where they will implement their proposed solution.
3. Once they submit their solution for analysis, participants should create a PR against the repository for analysis.
   Please make sure your solution meets [the minimum requirements described here](general-rules.md#solution-requirements).
4. Each contribution will be reviewed on a first come, first served basis.
   Acceptance will be based on a review by a committee.
5. Once approved by the review committee, the change will be merged into the repository.

## Solution Requirements

A proposed solution to a verification problem will only **be reviewed** if all the minimum requirements below are met:

* Each contribution or attempt should be submitted via a pull request to be analyzed by reviewers.
* By submitting the solution, participants confirm that they can use, modify, copy, and redistribute their contribution,
  under the terms of their choice.
* The contribution must be automated and should be checked and pass as part of the PR checks.
* All tools used by the solution must be in [the list of accepted tools](tools.md#approved-tools),
  and previously integrated in the repository.
  If that is not the case, please submit a separate [tool application first](./general-rules.md#tool-applications).
* There is no restriction on the number of contributors for a solution.
  Make sure you have the rights to submit your solution and that all contributors are properly mentioned.
* The solution cannot impact the runtime logic of the standard library unless the change is proposed and incorporated
  into the Rust standard library.

Any exception to these requirements will only be considered if it is specified as part of the acceptance criteria of the
challenged being solved.

## Call for Challenges

The goal of the effort is to enable the verification of the entire Rust standard library.
The type of obstacles users face may depend on which part of the standard library you would like to verify. Thus, our challenges are developed with the target of verifying a specific section of the standard library or strengthening existing verification.

Everyone is welcome to submit new challenge proposals for review by our committee.
Follow the following steps to create a new proposal:

1. Create a tracking issue using the [challenge template](./challenge_template.md) for your challenge.
2. In your fork of this repository do the following:
    1. Copy the template file (`book/src/challenge_template.md`) to `book/src/challenges/<ID_NUMBER>-<challenge-name>.md`.
    2. Fill in the details according to the template instructions.
    3. Add a link to the new challenge inside `book/src/SUMMARY.md`
    4. Submit a pull request.
3. Address any feedback in the pull request.
4. If approved, we will publish your challenge and add the “Challenge” label to the tracking issue.

## Tool Applications

Solutions must be automated using one of the tools previously approved and listed [here](tools.md#approved-tools).
To use a new tool, participants must first submit an application for it.

* To submit a tool application, open a new issue in this repository using the "Tool Application" issue template.
* The committee will review the application. Once a committee member approves the application, the participant needs to create a PR with:
  * A new workflow that runs the tool against the standard library.
  * A new entry to the “Approved Tools” section of this book.
* Once this PR is merged, the tool is considered integrated, and the tool application issue will be closed.

The repository will be updated periodically, which can impact a tool's capacity to analyze the new version of the repository (i.e., the workflow may no longer pass after an update).
If it is determined that the tool requires changes and such changes cannot be provided in a timely fashion the tool's approval may be revoked.

## Committee Applications

You can apply to be part of the committee by submitting a pull request that adds your GitHub login name to the `pull_request.toml` file.

For example, if your user login is @rahulku, add the login without @ to the committee member's list,
```
[committee]
members = [
+   "rahulku"
]
```

Committee members are expected to contribute by reviewing pull requests (all
pull requests review approvals from at least two committee members before they
can be merged).
Reviews of solutions towards challenges should consider at least the following aspects:

1. Does the pull request implement a solution that respects/meets the success
   criteria of the challenge?
2. Do the contracts and harnesses incorporate the safety conditions stated in
   the documentation (from comments in the code and the
   [standard library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html))?
   Note that we currently focus on safety verification. Pre- and post-conditions
   towards functional correctness are acceptable as long as they do not
   negatively impact verification of safety, such as over-constraining input
   values or causing excessive verification run time.
3. Is the contributed code of adequate quality, idiomatic, and stands a chance
   to be accepted into the standard library (to the best of the committee
   member's knowledge)?
