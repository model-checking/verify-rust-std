//! ARM's Transactional Memory Extensions (TME).
//!
//! This CPU feature is available on Aarch64 â€“ ARMv8-A arch. onwards.
//! This feature is in the non-neon feature set. TME specific vendor documentation can
//! be found [TME Intrinsics Introduction][tme_intrinsics_intro].
//!
//! The reference is [ACLE Q4 2019][acle_q4_2019_ref].
//!
//! ACLE has a section for TME extensions and state masks for aborts and failure codes.
//! In addition to that [LLVM Aarch64 Intrinsics][llvm_aarch64_int] are
//! self explanatory for what needs to be exported.
